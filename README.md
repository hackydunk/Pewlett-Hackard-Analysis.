# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
Berkeley Bootcamp - Module 7

## Project Overview
All of Bobby’s hard work has paid off. The database modeling is clean and clear. The relationships that Bobby mapped out with the ERD helped with creating all of the different queries he worked through. Speaking of queries, the lists Bobby produced generated much enthusiasm in the office!

In fact, everyone is so impressed that they requested a few more lists. Also, the HR Director got wind of the great work that has been completed and would like an additional list of employees who would be good candidates for a supervisory role. Ideally, these candidates would be born in 1965.

## Resources
- Software: PostgresSQL Version 12

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you will use advanced queries and joins to create a list of candidates for the mentorship program. To complete this task, you’ll use your knowledge of aliasing, filtering, and creating new tables.

## Challenge Summary

Number of Individuals Retiring: 41,380  
Number of Individuals Being Hired: missing data for this  
Number of Individuals available for the mentorship role: 1,549  

Further analysis on this data could include looking at which departments are going to have the most retirees or which deparments are costing the most money to be paid annually in salary.
